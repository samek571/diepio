## 1. Introduction

This game is a single-player version of [diep.io](https://diep.io) made in the Godot engine using C# language. The player controls a tank that shoots bullets to destroy enemies and debris, earning experience points (XP) to level up and improve stats of a tank. The game emphasizes strategic upgrades and survival against enemies. It was my second actual project, I got forced into something like this by the university.

### Tips for Players
- use auto-shoot as it is helpful only, leaving you to worry only on movement and dodging.
- Prioritize upgrades based on your play style; more aggressive players may favor bullet damage and speed, while defensive players may prioritize health and healing speed.
- Watch the enemy spawn rate and plan your movements accordingly.
